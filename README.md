Feature engineering

In any supervised learning projects, one of the first and most important steps is to create relevent features from raw data that help facilitate the learning process. Although many of the raw data fields can be directly used to train a model, customized features are expected to provide additional information that is not apparent in the original feature set. Such decisions often require domain knowledge and business logic. For example, features at different granularity levels and temporal categories are often constructed for demand forecasting or price prediction.
